                            <h5>~ Roy Mustang (Full Metal Alchemist)</h5>
                            <p>Roy Mustang is a character from Full Metal Alchemist who isn't afraid to speak his mind. In this quote, he talks about how imperfect the world can be. Ironically, alchemy can make it perfect via equivalent exchange.  But in the end, Roy says that the world being imperfect is 'perfect.' There is no such thing as perfection. Because once there is perfection, where do you go?</p>
